Gender-Specific Speech Emotion Recognition Web App

This project is a **speech emotion recognition (SER)** system that:
- Accepts `.wav` audio files as input
- Automatically detects the speaker's gender using a pretrained **ECAPA-TDNN model**
- Uses a gender-specific **CNN emotion classifier** to predict one of 8 emotions
- Is deployed as a **Streamlit web app**

Models Used

- **Gender Detection**:
  - Model: [`JaesungHuh/voice-gender-classifier`](https://huggingface.co/JaesungHuh/voice-gender-classifier)
  - Framework: `speechbrain`, `ECAPA-TDNN`
  
- **Emotion Classification**:
  - 2 separate **CNN models** trained using gender-specific feature distributions
  - Trained on features: MFCC, Chroma, Tonnetz, Spectral Contrast, Mel-Spectrogram, etc.
  - Output: 8 emotions
