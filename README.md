Gender-Specific Speech Emotion Recognition Web App

This project is a **speech emotion recognition (SER)** system that:
- Accepts `.wav` audio files as input
- Automatically detects the speaker's gender using a pretrained **ECAPA-TDNN model**
- Uses a gender-specific **CNN emotion classifier** to predict one of 8 emotions
- CNN architecture with:
  Conv1D → MaxPool → Dropout → Conv1D → MaxPool → Dense → Softmax
- Is deployed as a **Streamlit web app**

## SUGGESTION - USE VIRTUAL ENV TO DOWNLOAD PACKAGES ( REQUIREMENTS.TXT )
## TRAINING AND INFERENCING IDEA AND THOUGHT PROCESS HAVE BEEN ATTACHED IN JPEG FILES 
## script.py file will be used when you want to predict outcomes for a Test folder ( give the path to test folder , will save results in CSV file )
## app.py file will be used to test stream-lit 
To launch the app:

bash
Copy
Edit
streamlit run app.py
## See common_pred.ipynb to verify Final Results ( Reports and Confusion matrix )
## male.ipynb - male model training ( Reports and confusion matrix )
## female.ipynb - same
## male_models/  contains all the .pkl and .keras files 
## female_models/ same




Error to take care of :  prefer to use CPU instead of GPU because of presence of torch , if you want to use, then tell externally SYS.PATH
## if any other issue is found please contact me....i will work on it.

Models Used

- **Gender Detection**:
  - Model: [`JaesungHuh/voice-gender-classifier`](https://huggingface.co/JaesungHuh/voice-gender-classifier)
  - Framework: `speechbrain`, `ECAPA-TDNN`
  
- **Emotion Classification**:
  - 2 separate **CNN models** trained using gender-specific feature distributions
  - Trained on features: MFCC, Chroma, Tonnetz, Spectral Contrast, Mel-Spectrogram, etc.
  - Output: 8 emotions

## 😃 Emotions Predicted

| Label | Emotion     |
|-------|-------------|
| 0     | Neutral     |
| 1     | Calm        |
| 2     | Happy       |
| 3     | Sad         |
| 4     | Angry       |
| 5     | Fearful     |
| 6     | Disgust     |
| 7     | Surprised   |

## 🛠️ Features Used

Extracted using `librosa`:
- MFCCs (mean, std, median)
- Chroma STFT
- Spectral Contrast
- Tonnetz
- Mel-Spectrogram (mean, std, max, median)
- Spectral Centroid, Bandwidth, Rolloff, Flatness
- Zero Crossing Rate
- RMS Energy

## KEY FEATURES - 
1. Use of JaesungHuh/voice-gender-classifier to accurately predict gender model, can also use this model to define Female and Male dataset instead of classifying them on the basis of their name , tried but this is     increasing inferencing time.

2. Can integrate Wav2Vec2Model ( model = Wav2Vec2Model.from_pretrained("facebook/wav2vec2-base-960h") )   also to extract features instead of relying manually ....still inferencing time high.
